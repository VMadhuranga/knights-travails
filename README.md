# Knights Travails

This is The Odin Project curriculum's Knights Travails project assignment

This project intends to practice:

- How to find knight's shortest path from start to end position in chess board using Graph
- How to implement Breadth First Search to traverse through graph

### Usage

- Fork and clone the repo
- Inside local repo run `npm install`
- To get shortest path add desired start and end positions to `knightShortestPath` function in the below of `knights-travails.js`.

Eg:

```js
knightShortestPath([0, 0], [7, 7]); // => [ 0, 0 ][ 2, 1 ][ 4, 2 ][ 5, 0 ]
knightShortestPath([0, 2], [5, 6]); // => [ 0, 2 ][ 2, 3 ][ 4, 4 ][ 5, 6 ]
```
